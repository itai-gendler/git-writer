# Automatically select conflicting versions

## Trigger

Synchronization encounters conflicts while the configured strategy prefers local or remote versions.

## Outcome

All conflicts use the selected side, the resolution is committed, and the outgoing commits are pushed.

## Decision points

### Which version is kept?

Which automatic preference is selected?

- Local preference → keep local file versions.
- Remote preference → keep remote file versions.
